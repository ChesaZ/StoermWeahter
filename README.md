# StoermWeahter

This is my first serious app made. The app is a simple weather app allowing the user to view weather data fro his or hers current location as well as to view a weekly forecast and to add additional locations. The app includes several animations, custom transition between segues and some other nice touches I added myself. St√∂rm Weather uses the DarkSky weather API as it's data source. 

Below are included several images of the app:
