# StoermWeahter

This is my first serious app made. The app is a simple weather app allowing the user to view weather data fro his or hers current location as well as to view a weekly forecast and to add additional locations. The app includes several animations, custom transition between segues and some other nice touches I added myself. St√∂rm Weather uses the DarkSky weather API as it's data source. 

WARNING: I did not add any saving option, so once the app is closed and reopened the location that the user has added will not be saved, not would the changes that the user had done in the settings. I did not add any use od saving data because I did not intend this app to be used daily. Only to showcase a bit of my skill.

Below are included several images of the app:
